              From Stiff Shoulders to Inner Peace

            <div className="about-item-content">
              As an engineer, I spent long hours sitting in front of a computer,
              slowly developing poor posture and stiff shoulders. <br /> <br />
              One day, I realized this lifestyle wasn’t sustainable at all.
              <br /> <br />
              By chance, I stepped into a yoga class — and unexpectedly fell in
              love with it. <br /> <br />
              Since 2022, yoga has become a part of my life, helping me find
              balance both physically and mentally. It’s not just about
              flexibility — it’s about feeling good in my body and calming my
              mind.

              My first HYROX experience — and the energy on site was insane. I{" "}
              <br /> <br />
              just wanted to try out the 4-person relay, but that 2K run + 2
              workouts turned out to be an all-out sprint that completely burned
              me out. <br /> <br />
              HYROX is brutal, but addictive. For someone who loves strength
              training, this mix of cardio and weights is exactly my kind of
              fun. <br /> <br />
              It’s not about the results — what I love most is the process:
              preparing before the race, going all in during the race, and
              reflecting after. <br /> <br />
              That’s the beauty of training.

              Turning Point — Chasing My First Sub-3 Marathon
            </div>
            <div className="about-item-content">
              I joined my first half marathon without any training — and paid
              the price with severe knee pain. That moment made me realize how
              important running form and proper training are. <br /> <br />
              In early 2024, I joined a running club, gradually improved my
              pace, and met a group of passionate runners who keep inspiring me.
              <br /> <br /> Running is no longer just about speed. It’s about
              challenging myself and growing stronger, step by step.
              <br /> <br /> My goal is simple — keep running, keep improving,
              and chase my first sub-3 marathon.

              I used to think hiking Hehuan Mountain was already a big
              achievement — until I said yes without hesitation to my friend’s
              invitation to challenge the Biyang Ridge one-day hike.
              <br /> <br /> The journey was breathtaking. From lush green
              valleys to endless blue skies, every step reminded me of how
              magnificent nature can be.
              <br /> <br /> Although I was completely exhausted and clumsy on
              the way down, the memories of the stunning views and the joy of
              completing the challenge filled me with pure satisfaction. <br />{" "}
              <br />
              It was truly an unforgettable adventure.

              After signing up for the 99.9K challenge, I finally made the
              decision to buy my very first road bike — and that marked the
              beginning of my journey into the mountains. <br /> <br />
              Riding along winding mountain roads, feeling the breeze on my
              face, and moving faster through nature brought a whole new sense
              of freedom. <br /> <br />
              There’s nothing quite like the thrill of speed and the
              breathtaking scenery rushing past me. It’s an experience beyond
              words.

          The Best Part of Life Happens Outside Your Comfort Zone
        </div>
        <div className="about-conclusion-content">
          I've come to realize —   <br /> <br /> The best part of life happens when you step out
          of your comfort zone.   <br /> <br /> From running my first half marathon without
          training, to hiking an entire mountain ridge in one day, to joining my
          first HYROX race — none of these started because I was ready.  <br /> <br />  They
          started because I wanted to see how far I could go.  <br /> <br />  Every new
          challenge — running, hiking, yoga, skiing, triathlon — has helped me
          break my own limits and understand myself a little more.  <br /> <br />  You never
          really know what you're capable of — until you try.   <br /> <br /> Along the way,
          I've gained health, confidence, and most importantly, friends who love
          to challenge themselves and grow together.  <br /> <br />  This is the energy I want
          to keep — to keep exploring, stay curious, and share my stories with
          those who are also on their way.
